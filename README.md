# Top-4-Soccer-League-Winners
This project uses machine learning to predict the winners of the 2025–2026 seasons for LaLiga, the Premier League, Serie A, and the Bundesliga, along with each champion’s projected points total and win probability.

An exploratory data analysis was first conducted to examine team performance trends, feature distributions, and key factors influencing league success. Based on these insights, a Random Forest model was trained to capture non-linear relationships between features and generate predictions.

## Data
- Utilized data from fbref.com
- Gathered data from the past 10 seasons for each of the four leagues into csv files

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Evaluated team participation consistency across seasons
- Analyzed top-four finish frequency to identify dominant teams
- Isolated historical league winners to study championship profiles
- Computed average points per match for champions as a benchmark
