# Top-4-Soccer-League-Winners
This project uses machine learning to predict the winners of the 2025–2026 seasons for LaLiga, the Premier League, Serie A, and the Bundesliga, along with each champion’s projected points total and win probability.

An exploratory data analysis was first conducted to examine team performance trends, feature distributions, and key factors influencing league success. Based on these insights, a Random Forest model was trained to capture non-linear relationships between features and generate predictions.
